# Task ID: 1.5
# Title: Core Utilities & Storage Implementation
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Core Team
# Estimated Effort: 20h

## Description
Implement essential core utilities and storage systems that will be used throughout the entire Smart Backgrounds library. This includes storage wrappers (LocalStorage, IndexedDB), state management, math utilities, color utilities, logging, and event bus enhancements.

## Dependencies
- [x] Task ID: 1.2 (Core Engine must be implemented)
- [ ] Task ID: 1.1 (Monorepo must be set up)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] LocalStorage wrapper with error handling
- [ ] IndexedDB wrapper using Dexie.js for complex data
- [ ] State management setup with Zustand or Jotai
- [ ] Math utilities: vectors, interpolation, easing functions
- [ ] Color utilities: extraction, conversion (RGB, HSL, HEX)
- [ ] Logger with debug levels (info, warn, error, debug)
- [ ] Event bus enhancements for better performance
- [ ] All utilities have TypeScript types
- [ ] Comprehensive unit test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Documentation for all utilities

## Testing Instructions
1. Test storage: Write/read/delete data in LocalStorage and IndexedDB
2. Test state management: Create/update/subscribe to state
3. Test math utilities: Verify vector operations, interpolation accuracy
4. Test color utilities: Convert colors, extract dominant colors
5. Test logger: Verify log levels and output formatting
6. Test error handling: Simulate failures, verify graceful degradation
7. Performance test: Ensure utilities are optimized

## Security Review
- Sanitize all data before storage
- Prevent XSS attacks through color/string inputs
- Secure state management (no sensitive data leaks)
- Safe IndexedDB operations

## Risk Assessment
- Storage quota limits could cause failures
- Cross-browser IndexedDB compatibility issues
- Performance impact if utilities are inefficient
- State management bugs could affect entire app

## Notes
- Use Dexie.js for IndexedDB (simpler API)
- Choose lightweight state library (Zustand preferred)
- Math utilities should be tree-shakeable
- Color extraction may use Vibrant.js or colorthief
- Reference lines 372-381 in project-backlog.md

**ðŸ“š Reference:** `../project-backlog.md`
  - Lines 372-381: Core storage/ and utils/ structure
  - Lines 192-196: State management in Technology Stack
  - Technology Stack (lines 176-208) for library choices

## Strengths
- Provides foundation for all features
- Enables data persistence across sessions
- Improves code reusability
- Facilitates debugging and monitoring

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Implement LocalStorage wrapper
- [ ] Create IndexedDB wrapper with Dexie.js
- [ ] Set up state management (Zustand/Jotai)
- [ ] Build math utility library (vectors, interpolation, easing)
- [ ] Create color utility library (extraction, conversion)
- [ ] Implement logger with configurable levels
- [ ] Enhance EventBus for better performance
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests for all utilities
- [ ] Document all utility APIs
