# Task ID: 3
# Title: Phase 3 - Audio Reactivity & Sensor Integration
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Audio & Sensors Team
# Estimated Effort: 80h (Months 5-6)

## Description
Implement Feature #7 (Audio Reactivity) and Feature #8 (Sensor Integration) enabling backgrounds to respond to music/sound and device sensors like gyroscope, ambient light, and battery status.

**Feature #7: Audio Reactivity**
- AudioAnalyzer.ts (Web Audio API, spectrum analyzer)
- BeatDetector.ts (rhythm detection)
- FrequencyData.ts (FFT analysis)
- Microphone input integration
- Tone.js integration

**Feature #8: Sensor Integration**
- AmbientLight.ts (Ambient Light Sensor API)
- DeviceOrientation.ts (gyroscope, accelerometer)
- NetworkInfo.ts (Network Information API)
- Battery Status API
- Proximity sensor, device motion

**Success Criteria:**
- Audio visualizer syncs with music in real-time (<50ms latency)
- Beat detection accuracy >90%
- Gyroscope controls camera smoothly (60 FPS)
- Ambient light adjusts brightness automatically
- All sensors work cross-browser (with fallbacks)

## Dependencies
- [x] Task ID: 1 (Core features system)
- [x] Task ID: 2 (Three.js effects to visualize audio)

## Testing Instructions
1. Test audio analyzer with various music genres
2. Verify beat detection on 100+ songs
3. Test microphone input with user permission
4. Test gyroscope on mobile devices (iOS, Android)
5. Verify ambient light sensor on supported devices
6. Test battery status API across browsers
7. Check sensor data â†’ visual effect latency (<50ms)
8. Test graceful fallbacks when APIs unavailable

## Security Review
- Require explicit user permission for microphone
- Ensure audio data isn't recorded/transmitted
- Validate sensor APIs respect privacy
- Check no fingerprinting via sensor combinations
- Review Tone.js for security issues

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk**: Browser API availability varies
- Ambient Light API deprecated in some browsers
- Battery Status API privacy concerns
- Sensor permissions may be denied by users

**Mitigation:**
- Implement graceful fallbacks
- Clear permission prompts
- Progressive enhancement (works without sensors)

## Strengths
- Audio reactivity is highly engaging
- Sensor integration creates immersive experiences
- Gyroscope parallax is unique on mobile
- Ambient light adaptation improves accessibility

## Notes
- Web Audio API is well-supported
- Beat detection uses autocorrelation algorithm
- Sensor APIs have varying browser support
- Tone.js provides high-level audio utilities
