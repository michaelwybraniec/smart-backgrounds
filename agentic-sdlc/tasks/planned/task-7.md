# Task ID: 7
# Title: Phase 7 - ML/AI Features
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: medium
# Owner: AI/ML Team
# Estimated Effort: 120h

## Description
Implement Machine Learning and AI features (#5, #9, #14) including TensorFlow.js integration, pattern generation, preference learning, computer vision (MediaPipe), hand gesture recognition, voice recognition, and personalization engine.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1 (Core Package)
- [ ] Task ID: 4 (Context Awareness for data)
- [ ] Task ID: 2 (Three.js for visual ML outputs)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TensorFlow.js integrated
- [ ] AI pattern generation from page content
- [ ] User preference learning system
- [ ] MediaPipe for hand/pose tracking
- [ ] Hand gesture recognition (#14)
- [ ] Web Speech API voice recognition integration
- [ ] Personalization engine with local ML models
- [ ] Privacy-first: all ML processing local
- [ ] Performance: ML doesn't block main thread
- [ ] Fallback for browsers without ML support
- [ ] Complete documentation and examples

## Testing Instructions
1. Test pattern generation with various content
2. Test preference learning over multiple sessions
3. Test gesture recognition accuracy
4. Test voice command recognition
5. Performance test: Verify ML doesn't impact FPS
6. Privacy test: Confirm no data leaves browser
7. Fallback test: Verify graceful degradation
8. Cross-browser compatibility test

## Security Review
- All ML processing must be local (no cloud)
- User permission required for camera/microphone
- Privacy policy compliance
- Secure model loading and execution
- Input sanitization for ML models

## Risk Assessment
- High computational cost of ML models
- Browser compatibility issues (WebGL required)
- Model size impacting bundle size
- Complex debugging of ML behaviors
- Privacy concerns if not implemented correctly

## Notes
- Use TensorFlow.js Lite for smaller models
- MediaPipe provides pre-trained models
- Web Speech API has good browser support
- Consider Web Workers for ML processing
- Adaptive ML quality based on device
