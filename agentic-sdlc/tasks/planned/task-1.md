# Task ID: 1
# Title: Phase 1 - Foundation & Core Package Setup
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: critical
# Owner: Dev Team Lead
# Estimated Effort: 80h (Months 1-2)

## Description
Establish the foundational infrastructure for the Smart Backgrounds project including monorepo setup, core package architecture, and initial smart features (Performance Intelligence and User Behavior Response). This phase creates the backbone for all 29 smart features and 7 packages.

**Key Deliverables:**
- pnpm + Turborepo monorepo structure
- @smart-backgrounds/core package with engine (SmartBackground, FeatureManager, EventBus)
- Feature #1: Performance Intelligence (FPS monitoring, adaptive quality, GPU detection, battery management)
- Feature #2: User Behavior Response (mouse tracking, scroll tracking, gestures)
- Core utilities (math, color, events, logger)
- Storage layer (LocalStorage, IndexedDB, StateManager)

**Success Criteria:**
- Monorepo builds successfully with pnpm
- Core engine can load and manage plugins
- Performance monitoring tracks 60 FPS target
- Mouse and scroll interactions work
- Tree-shakeable architecture verified

## Dependencies
- None (Initial task)

## Testing Instructions
1. Run `pnpm install` - should install all workspace dependencies
2. Run `pnpm build` - should build core package successfully
3. Test SmartBackground instantiation and plugin loading
4. Verify PerformanceMonitor tracks FPS correctly
5. Test MouseTracker and ScrollTracker on demo page
6. Verify tree-shaking removes unused features
7. Check bundle size <20KB gzipped for core

## Security Review
- Ensure no credentials in tsconfig or package.json
- Validate EventBus doesn't expose internal state
- Check plugin system prevents malicious plugin injection
- Review storage utilities for XSS vulnerabilities

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk**: Foundation issues will cascade to all 16 phases
- Poor architecture â†’ difficult to add 29 features
- Performance issues â†’ won't hit 60 FPS target
- Plugin system bugs â†’ features can't be modularized

**Mitigation:**
- Follow established patterns (Three.js plugin architecture)
- Performance testing from day 1
- Code review for architecture decisions

## Strengths
- Establishes quality standards for entire project
- Plugin architecture enables clean separation of 29 features
- Performance-first approach aligns with <60KB bundle target
- Enables parallel development of features once complete

## Notes
- Based on base.md lines 488-805 (project structure)
- Core package inspired by Three.js modular architecture
- Performance Intelligence critical for mobile-first goal

**ðŸ“š Complete Reference Documentation:**
- **project-backlog.md** (1,860 lines) - ALL specifications consolidated
  - 33 major sections covering every aspect
  - All 29 smart features detailed
  - Complete 228-file architecture
  - Full API documentation, examples, and guides
