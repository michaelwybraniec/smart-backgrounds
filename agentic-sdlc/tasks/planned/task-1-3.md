## Description
Implement Smart Feature #1: Performance Intelligence system that auto-detects device capabilities and dynamically adjusts quality to maintain 60 FPS target. Critical for mobile-first and <60KB bundle goals.

**Components to Build:**
1. **PerformanceMonitor.ts** - FPS tracking using Web Performance API + stats.js
2. **AdaptiveQuality.ts** - Dynamic quality adjustment based on FPS
3. **GPUDetector.ts** - WebGL capability detection
4. **BatteryManager.ts** - Battery Status API integration
5. **Tab visibility detection** - Pause when inactive
6. **Frame rate drop monitoring** - Auto-adjust on performance degradation

**Performance Targets:**
- Maintain 60 FPS on all devices
- Detect FPS drops within 100ms
- Adjust quality within 200ms
- Battery mode reduces CPU usage by 50%
- Tab pause saves 99% resources

## Dependencies
- [x] Task ID: 1.2 (Core engine must support plugins)

## Testing Instructions
1. Test FPS monitoring tracks correctly (60 FPS baseline)
2. Simulate low FPS â†’ verify quality reduction
3. Test GPU capability detection on various devices
4. Verify battery mode activates when battery <20%
5. Test tab visibility â†’ background pauses
6. Benchmark quality adjustment latency (<200ms)
7. Test on mobile devices (iPhone, Android)
8. Verify no memory leaks during quality changes

## Security Review
- Ensure Performance API data doesn't expose sensitive info
- Validate Battery Status API respects privacy
- Check no fingerprinting via GPU detection
- Review that monitoring doesn't become DDoS vector

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk**: Poor performance defeats project purpose
- Inaccurate FPS tracking â†’ wrong quality adjustments
- Slow quality changes â†’ janky user experience
- Battery drain â†’ users disable backgrounds

**Mitigation:**
- Use proven libraries (stats.js) where possible
- Test on wide range of devices
- Conservative quality reduction (better safe than janky)

## Strengths
- Core differentiator from competitors
- Enables 60 FPS on low-end devices
- Battery awareness improves user experience
- Automatic optimization reduces developer effort

## Notes
- 60 FPS = 16.67ms per frame budget
- Use stats.js for FPS monitoring
- Adaptive quality: high â†’ medium â†’ low â†’ minimal
- Battery Status API deprecated in some browsers (fallback needed)
