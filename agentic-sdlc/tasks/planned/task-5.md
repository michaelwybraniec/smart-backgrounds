# Task ID: 5
# Title: Phase 5 - Canvas & CSS Packages
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: medium
# Owner: Renderer Team
# Estimated Effort: 80h

## Description
Create the Canvas and CSS renderer packages providing lightweight alternatives to Three.js. Canvas package includes effects like Perlin noise, flow fields, matrix rain, and cellular automata. CSS package provides pure CSS/SVG animated gradients, patterns, and morphing shapes.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1 (Core Package with plugin system)
- [ ] Task ID: 2 (Three.js package as reference)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] @smart-backgrounds/canvas package created
- [ ] @smart-backgrounds/css package created
- [ ] Canvas effects: Perlin noise, flow fields, matrix rain, cellular automata, gradient meshes
- [ ] CSS effects: Animated gradients, SVG patterns, morphing shapes, mesh gradients
- [ ] Both packages use core plugin system
- [ ] Performance: 60 FPS on mid-range devices
- [ ] Bundle sizes: Canvas <15KB gzipped, CSS <5KB gzipped
- [ ] Adapters for audio and sensor data
- [ ] Web Workers for Canvas heavy computations
- [ ] Complete documentation and examples

## Testing Instructions
1. Test all Canvas effects independently
2. Test all CSS effects independently
3. Performance test: Verify 60 FPS targets
4. Bundle size test: Verify gzip targets
5. Integration test: Use with core features
6. Cross-browser test: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
7. Mobile test: Verify mobile performance

## Security Review
- Sanitize any user-provided colors/styles
- Prevent CSS injection attacks
- Safe Web Worker usage
- OffscreenCanvas security considerations

## Risk Assessment
- Canvas performance issues on low-end devices
- CSS animation browser compatibility
- Web Worker complexity and debugging
- Bundle size creep

## Notes
- Canvas uses OffscreenCanvas for better performance
- CSS should be progressive enhancement
- Reference Three.js adapters for consistency
- Prioritize lightweight and tree-shakeable code

## Strengths
- Provides lightweight alternatives to Three.js
- Lower barrier to entry for users
- Better performance on low-end devices
- Expands user options
