# Task ID: 1.4
# Title: Feature #2 - User Behavior Response Implementation
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Core Team
# Estimated Effort: 16h

## Description
Implement the User Behavior Response smart feature that enables backgrounds to react to user interactions including mouse movement, scrolling, touch gestures, and velocity-based interactions. This feature is critical for creating truly interactive backgrounds that respond to user input.

## Dependencies
- [x] Task ID: 1.2 (Core Engine must be implemented)
- [ ] Task ID: 1.1 (Monorepo must be set up)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MouseTracker captures cursor position, velocity, and direction
- [ ] ScrollTracker monitors scroll position, direction, and velocity
- [ ] GestureRecognizer handles touch gestures (swipe, pinch, tap)
- [ ] Parallax effects based on mouse/scroll position
- [ ] Event throttling to prevent performance issues
- [ ] Works on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Integrated with EventBus for data distribution
- [ ] Unit tests cover all tracking functionality
- [ ] Documentation for API usage

## Testing Instructions
1. Test mouse tracking: Move cursor, verify position and velocity data
2. Test scroll tracking: Scroll page, verify direction and position
3. Test touch gestures: Swipe, pinch, tap on mobile device
4. Test parallax: Verify smooth parallax effects
5. Performance test: Ensure 60 FPS with heavy mouse movement
6. Cross-browser test: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Security Review
- Ensure no tracking of user data beyond session
- Respect user privacy settings
- Handle input sanitization for safety

## Risk Assessment
- High CPU usage if not throttled properly
- Cross-browser compatibility issues with touch events
- Performance degradation on low-end devices

## Notes
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smooth updates
- Implement adaptive throttling based on device capabilities
- Consider accessibility: keyboard navigation, reduced motion

## Strengths
- Creates engaging, interactive backgrounds
- Enhances user experience significantly
- Works across all device types
- Foundation for advanced interaction features

## Sub-tasks
- [ ] Implement MouseTracker with position/velocity
- [ ] Build ScrollTracker with direction detection
- [ ] Create GestureRecognizer for touch events
- [ ] Add parallax calculation utilities
- [ ] Implement event throttling system
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Write documentation and examples
