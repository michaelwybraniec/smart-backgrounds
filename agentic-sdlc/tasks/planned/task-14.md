# Task ID: 14
# Title: Phase 14 - Build, CI/CD & Release
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: critical
# Owner: DevOps Team
# Estimated Effort: 40h

## Description
Set up build pipelines, CI/CD automation (GitHub Actions), bundle size monitoring, release automation, NPM publishing, and changelog generation. Prepare for v1.0 production release.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 13 (Testing must be complete)
- [ ] Task ID: 12 (Documentation must be ready)
- [ ] All packages (1-11) must be production-ready

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Automated testing on every PR
- [ ] Bundle size monitoring with budgets
- [ ] Automated NPM publishing
- [ ] Semantic versioning automation
- [ ] Changelog generation (conventional commits)
- [ ] Release notes automation
- [ ] CDN deployment (unpkg, jsdelivr)
- [ ] GitHub Releases with assets
- [ ] Version tagging automated
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented
- [ ] Pre-release and beta channel support

## Testing Instructions
1. Test CI/CD: Push to branch, verify pipeline runs
2. Test PR checks: Create PR, verify all checks pass
3. Test bundle monitoring: Verify alerts on size increase
4. Test NPM publish: Dry-run publish
5. Test changelog: Verify correct generation
6. Test release: Create test release
7. Test CDN: Verify packages on unpkg/jsdelivr
8. Test rollback: Verify rollback procedures work

## Security Review
- Secure NPM tokens in CI/CD
- GitHub Actions security best practices
- Package signing for NPM
- SRI hashes for CDN
- Secrets management in CI/CD
- Audit logs for releases

## Risk Assessment
- Failed release could block users
- Bundle size regressions unnoticed
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Breaking changes without proper versioning
- CI/CD downtime blocks development

## Notes
- Use semantic-release for automation
- Conventional commits for changelog
- Bundle size budgets: core <20KB, three <45KB
- Monitor Bundlephobia for size tracking
- Document emergency rollback procedures
