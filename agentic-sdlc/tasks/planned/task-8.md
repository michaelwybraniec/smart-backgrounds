# Task ID: 8
# Title: Phase 8 - Collaborative & Revolutionary Features
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: low
# Owner: Advanced Features Team
# Estimated Effort: 150h

## Description
Implement Collaborative/Social features (#12) and Revolutionary features including Cross-Device Sync (#22), Living/Evolving Backgrounds (#21), and multiplayer interactions. Uses WebSocket/WebRTC for real-time communication and genetic algorithms for evolution.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1 (Core Package)
- [ ] Task ID: 2 (Three.js for visual output)
- [ ] Task ID: 7 (ML for evolution algorithms)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] WebSocket/WebRTC infrastructure
- [ ] Cross-device sync (#22) working
- [ ] QR code transfer for device handoff
- [ ] Multiplayer cursor visualization (#12)
- [ ] Living/evolving backgrounds (#21) with genetic algorithms
- [ ] Shared color themes in team environments
- [ ] Real-time collaboration indicators
- [ ] Optional blockchain verification for unique instances
- [ ] Privacy-first: opt-in for all social features
- [ ] Performance: real-time sync doesn't impact FPS
- [ ] Complete documentation

## Testing Instructions
1. Test cross-device sync: Transfer background between devices
2. Test QR code handoff: Scan and transfer state
3. Test multiplayer cursors: Multiple users, verify sync
4. Test evolving backgrounds: Verify genetic algorithm evolution
5. Performance test: Verify real-time sync performance
6. Privacy test: Verify opt-in and data control
7. Network resilience test: Handle disconnections gracefully
8. Cross-browser and cross-device testing

## Security Review
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- WebRTC security and encryption
- QR code generation safety
- Privacy: user control over shared data
- Prevent unauthorized access to shared sessions
- GDPR compliance for collaborative features

## Risk Assessment
- Complex real-time synchronization
- Network latency affecting user experience
- WebRTC browser compatibility issues
- Security vulnerabilities in real-time features
- Blockchain integration complexity (optional)

## Notes
- Use Socket.io or native WebSocket
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer when possible
- QR codes use qrcode.js library
- Genetic algorithms can be computationally expensive
- These are "moonshot" features for v2.0
