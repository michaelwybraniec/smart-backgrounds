# Task ID: 13
# Title: Phase 13 - Testing & Quality Assurance
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: critical
# Owner: QA Team
# Estimated Effort: 60h

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure including unit tests (Vitest), end-to-end tests (Playwright), WebGL testing utilities, cross-browser testing, performance testing, and accessibility testing. Achieve >90% code coverage.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1-11 (All packages to test)
- [ ] Task ID: 12 (Documentation for test scenarios)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests with Vitest (>90% coverage)
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] WebGL testing utilities
- [ ] Cross-browser test matrix (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile device testing (iOS, Android)
- [ ] Performance testing (FPS, bundle size, load time)
- [ ] Accessibility testing (axe, WCAG compliance)
- [ ] Visual regression testing
- [ ] CI/CD integration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Test reports and coverage badges
- [ ] Performance benchmarks documented
- [ ] Automated test runs on every PR

## Testing Instructions
1. Run all unit tests: `pnpm test`
2. Run E2E tests: `pnpm test:e2e`
3. Check coverage: `pnpm test:coverage`
4. Run performance tests: `pnpm test:perf`
5. Run accessibility tests: `pnpm test:a11y`
6. Visual regression: `pnpm test:visual`
7. Cross-browser: Run on BrowserStack/Sauce Labs
8. CI/CD: Verify all tests pass in pipeline

## Security Review
- Test for XSS vulnerabilities
- Test CSP compliance
- Test for memory leaks
- Security audit with npm audit
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

## Risk Assessment
- Low test coverage delays release
- Flaky tests cause CI/CD issues
- Missing edge cases cause production bugs
- Performance regression undetected
- Accessibility issues block launch

## Notes
- Use Vitest for speed and Vite integration
- Playwright for reliable E2E testing
- WebGL testing requires headless browser with GPU
- Performance tests should be automated
- Accessibility is non-negotiable
