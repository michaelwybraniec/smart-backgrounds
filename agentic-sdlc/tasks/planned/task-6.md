# Task ID: 6
# Title: Phase 6 - Physics Package
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: medium
# Owner: Advanced Features Team
# Estimated Effort: 100h

## Description
Create the Physics package (@smart-backgrounds/physics) that enables advanced physics-based backgrounds using Matter.js and/or Rapier physics engines. Includes gravity simulations, soft body physics, biological growth patterns, and quantum particle behavior (#24).

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1 (Core Package)
- [ ] Task ID: 2 (Three.js for visualization)
- [ ] Task ID: 3 (Sensors for interactive physics)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] @smart-backgrounds/physics package created
- [ ] Matter.js integration complete
- [ ] Optional Rapier physics engine support
- [ ] Gravity simulation effects
- [ ] Soft body physics simulation
- [ ] Biological growth pattern effects
- [ ] Quantum particle behavior (#24)
- [ ] Physics adapters for sensor input
- [ ] Performance: 60 FPS with reasonable complexity
- [ ] Bundle size: <50KB gzipped (Matter.js is user's responsibility)
- [ ] Complete API documentation
- [ ] Interactive examples

## Testing Instructions
1. Test gravity simulation accuracy
2. Test soft body deformation and collisions
3. Test biological growth patterns
4. Test quantum particle behavior
5. Performance test: Verify FPS with various particle counts
6. Integration test: Connect with sensors (gyroscope affects gravity)
7. Cross-browser compatibility test
8. Mobile performance test

## Security Review
- Ensure physics calculations don't cause infinite loops
- Prevent memory leaks from physics bodies
- Safe physics engine integration
- Input validation for physics parameters

## Risk Assessment
- Physics engines are computationally expensive
- Complex debugging of physics behaviors
- Browser compatibility issues
- Performance degradation on mobile devices

## Notes
- Matter.js is more accessible, Rapier is faster but WebAssembly
- Physics adds significant bundle size (user responsibility)
- Consider adaptive physics quality based on device
- Quantum behavior can be simplified for performance
