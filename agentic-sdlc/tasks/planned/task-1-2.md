# Task ID: 1.2

# Title: Core Engine (SmartBackground, FeatureManager, EventBus)

# Status: [x] Complete

# Priority: critical

# Owner: Core Architecture Team

# Estimated Effort: 20h

## Description

Build the core engine for @smart-backgrounds/core package including the main SmartBackground class, plugin-based FeatureManager, and EventBus communication system. This engine orchestrates all 29 smart features.

**Core Components:**

1. **SmartBackground.ts** - Main entry point, API facade
2. **FeatureManager.ts** - Plugin system for loading/managing features
3. **EventBus.ts** - Event-driven communication between features
4. **types.ts** - TypeScript interfaces and types

**Architecture:**

- Plugin-based architecture (inspired by Three.js)
- Event-driven communication (loose coupling)
- Lazy loading support for features
- Tree-shakeable exports

**API Design:**

```typescript
const bg = new SmartBackground({
  renderer: 'three',
  effect: ParticleSystem,
  features: {
    performance: { enabled: true },
    audio: { enabled: true },
  },
});
bg.mount('#background');
```

## Dependencies

- [x] Task ID: 1.1 (Monorepo setup must be complete)

## Testing Instructions

1. Unit test SmartBackground class instantiation
2. Test FeatureManager can load/unload plugins
3. Verify EventBus pub/sub works correctly
4. Test feature dependency resolution
5. Verify lazy loading doesn't load unused features
6. Check tree-shaking removes disabled features
7. Test error handling for invalid config
8. Benchmark plugin load time (<10ms per plugin)

## Security Review

- Validate plugin system prevents code injection
- Ensure EventBus doesn't leak sensitive data
- Check feature isolation (plugins can't access each other's internals)
- Review configuration validation for XSS risks

## Risk Assessment

**High Risk**: Core engine bugs affect all 29 features

- Poor plugin architecture â†’ hard to add features
- EventBus memory leaks â†’ performance degradation
- Circular dependencies â†’ build errors

**Mitigation:**

- Extensive unit testing (>90% coverage)
- Code review from senior engineers
- Architecture documented and validated

## Strengths

- Plugin architecture makes 29 features manageable
- Event-driven design enables loose coupling
- Lazy loading improves initial bundle size
- Tree-shaking removes unused code
- Clean API makes library easy to use

## Notes

- Design pattern: Facade + Plugin + Observer
- Inspired by Three.js and Vue.js plugin systems
- EventBus uses WeakMap to prevent memory leaks
- FeatureManager maintains plugin lifecycle
