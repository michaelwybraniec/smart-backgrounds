# Task ID: 4
# Title: Phase 4 - Context Awareness & Accessibility
# Status: [ ] Pending
# Priority: high
# Owner: Core Features Team
# Estimated Effort: 60h

## Description
Implement Context Awareness (#3) and Accessibility Intelligence (#4) features that enable backgrounds to adapt to user environment (time, theme, weather) and ensure WCAG compliance with accessibility features like reduced motion support, contrast management, and calm modes.

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task ID: 1 (Core Package Foundation)
- [ ] Task ID: 2 (Three.js Package for testing)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Theme detection (light/dark mode) working
- [ ] Time-based effects (day/night/season)
- [ ] Weather API integration (OpenWeatherMap)
- [ ] Color extraction from page content
- [ ] prefers-reduced-motion support
- [ ] Contrast management for accessibility
- [ ] ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] Calm mode implementation
- [ ] All features respect user preferences
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant

## Testing Instructions
1. Test theme detection: Switch OS theme, verify background adapts
2. Test time-based: Change system time, verify effects change
3. Test weather integration: Verify API calls and data usage
4. Test color extraction: Load pages with different colors
5. Test accessibility: Enable reduced motion, verify calm mode
6. Test contrast: Verify readability with different backgrounds
7. Screen reader test: Verify ARIA labels work correctly

## Security Review
- Secure API key storage for weather services
- Privacy: Don't track user location without consent
- Input sanitization for color extraction
- GDPR compliance for any data collection

## Risk Assessment
- Weather API rate limits or downtime
- Cross-browser theme detection issues
- Color extraction performance impact
- Accessibility compliance failure could block launch

## Notes
- Use matchMedia API for theme and reduced motion
- Cache weather data to respect API limits
- Color extraction should be async and cached
- Accessibility is non-negotiable per project philosophy
